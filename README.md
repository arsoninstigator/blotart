# blot @ a hack club ysws
this is my first attempt at generating art through code using the blot engine on the [blot editor](https://blot.hackclub.com/editor). my artwork is halloween themed because i started working on this towards the end of october and shows a cross section of a spooky empty cave with spiderwebs at each turn where bats fly through them
